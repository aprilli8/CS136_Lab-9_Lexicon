# Lexicon Thought Questions

1. For each node in the trie, you need to store pointers to its children nodes. What data structure did you use to store the pointers to children nodes? Justify the choice you made.
   * Data structure choice:
   * Justification:
2. Suppose we use an `OrderedVector` instead of a trie for storing our lexicon. Discuss how the process of searching for suggested spelling corrections would differ from our trie-based implementation. Which is more efficient? Why?
   * Searching in a trie:
   * Searching in an `OrderedVector`:
   * Which is more efficient? (_justify your answer_)
